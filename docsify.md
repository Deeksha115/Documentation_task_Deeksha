## What is Podman 

* The podman is pod manager tool and that's why the name is podman
* The name pods came from the kubonities. Collection of containers or Grouping of containers are called as pods
* The main reason for creating podman is to lavering the concept of pods where u have two containers run together mostly called them as a side car pattern . So We can use podman to run two different containers together.


## What is Github

* GitHub is an online software development platform. It's used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects.
* Github is an Version Control system 


### STEP 1 - Update Your System

```
sudo apt update
```

### STEP 2 - Podman Installation 

```
 sudo apt-get install -y podman
```

![Alt text](../Deeksha/upload/podman.png)


 **- sudo:** This part of the command is like saying "I want to do something important." It stands for "superuser do" and allows you to perform tasks that affect your computer's system, like installing software.

 **- apt-get:** Think of this as a magic tool that helps you add, update, and remove programs (software) on your computer. It's how you manage what software is installed.

**- install:**  This tells the magic tool that you want to put a new program on your computer.

**- -y:**  The -y is like saying, "Yes, go ahead!" It tells the magic tool to answer "Yes" to any questions it might ask during the installation, so you don't have to type "Yes" manually.

# Note:-
### If you have not installed podman so you can use these command given below âž–

```
# echo "deb https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable/xUbuntu_20.04/ /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable.list


sudo apt  install curl

# curl -L "https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable/xUbuntu_20.04/Release.key" -o Release.key




# file Release.key


# sudo apt-key add Release.key


# curl -L "https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable/xUbuntu20.04/Release.key" | gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/devel-kubic-libcontainers-stable.gpg



# sudo apt update
# sudo apt install podman


```

### STEP 3 - Check Podman Version

```
 podman --version
```

![Alt text](../Deeksha/upload/Checkpodmanversion.png)

**- podman:**  This is the name of the program or tool 


**- When you run podman --version,** Podman responds by showing you a number (e.g., "2.2.1"). This number represents the version of Podman that's currently installed. Knowing the version is helpful because different versions might have different features or behave in slightly different ways, so it's useful information if you're troubleshooting or working with Podman.

### STEP 4 - Create a Directory

```
 mkdir Directory
```
![Alt text](images/4.png)


**- mkdir:**  This is a command that stands for "make directory." It tells your computer that you want to create a new folder.

after creating a Directory name which is docsify and enter in the directory with command given below 

```
ls directory namae 
```

### STEP 5 - Create File In Directory

```
touch index.html
touch Dockerfile
touch README.md
```
![Alt text](images/5.png)

**- touch:**  This is a command that tells your computer to create a new file.
### STEP 6 - Open/Edit and paste the index.html syntex 

```
 vim index.html
```
![Alt text](images/6.png)

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify@4/themes/vue.css"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script>
      window.$docsify = {
        //...
      };
    </script>
    <script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify@4"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
![Alt text](images/7.png)
**- vim:**  This is the command to launch the Vim text editor.
### STEP 7 - Open/Edit and paste the Dockerfile 

```
 vim Dockerfile
```
![Alt text](images/8.png)

```
FROM node:latest
  LABEL description="A demo Dockerfile for build Docsify."
  WORKDIR /docs
  RUN npm install -g docsify-cli@latest
  EXPOSE 3000/tcp
  ENTRYPOINT docsify serve .

```
![Alt text](images/9.png)

### STEP 8 - This file is used to show the information about project 

```
 vim README.md

```
![Alt text](images/10.png)

### STEP 9 - Podman build image

```
 podman build -f Docerfile -t docsify/demo.

```
![Alt text](images/12.png)

**- Podman build image"** in simple words means creating a container image using Podman, which is a tool for managing containers (like virtualized software environments). Here's a breakdown:

**- Podman:** This is the tool you're using. It's similar to Docker and helps you work with containers.

**- Build:** This means you're instructing Podman to build something. In this case, you're telling it to construct a container image.

**- Image:** An image is like a snapshot of a software application and its dependencies. It's a blueprint that can be used to create and run containers. Think of it as a package containing everything needed to run a piece of software.

### STEP 10 - Podman run 

```
 podman run -d -p 3000:3000 -v/home/deeksha/Mydocs:/docs localhost/docsify/demo

```
![Alt text](images/13.png)

**- run:**  This part of the command tells Podman that you want to start and run a container with a specific image.

### STEP 11 - Container Check 
This command is used to check the running  container 

```
podman ps 
```
![Alt text](images/14.1.png)



This command is used to check the running and not running container 

```
 podman ps -a
  ```
![Alt text](images/14.png)


**- ps:** This stands for "process status." It's a command that helps you see information about the programs and tasks currently running on your computer.

**-a:**  This is an option or flag that you add to the "ps" command. It tells "ps" to display information about all processes, not just the ones associated with your current terminal session.


### STEP 12 - Preview

##  GITHUB 

## STEP :1 

-  Create a github  account and make a repository. To create a GitHub account Go to https://github.com/ Click on "Sign up" and follow the prompts to create your account then  Login github 
 .

![Alt text](login.png)

### STEP :2  

#### Create GitHub Repository

![Alt text](repo.png)

- Choose a name for your repository. Then Write a short description about your project or documentation. Choose whether the repository should be public or private. Then click create a repository.
![Alt text](newrepo.png)



## STEP :3 
#### create a new repository on the command line

- **git init** :- "git init" is like setting up a magic box that remembers all the changes you make to your files, so you can easily go back and see what you did later.

![Alt text](image.png)

- **git add README.md** :-  Command is used to tell Git that you want to include the changes you've made to the README.md file

![Alt text](<git add.png>)

- **git commit -m "first commit"** :-  Is like saving your work and adding a quick note to remember what you did. It's like taking a snapshot and writing a caption for it.

![Alt text](gitcommit.png)

- **git branch -M master** :-  (git branch) This tells Git you want to work with branches, which are different versions of your project.(M) This is a flag that means you're renaming or moving a branch.(master) This is the name of the branch you're renaming. In Git, "master" is often the default starting point.

![Alt text](<branch master.png>)

- **git remote add origin <https://github.com/Deeksha115/deeksha05.git>** :- This command is saying, "Git, I want to connect my local project to a place on GitHub called 'origin' using this web address.


![Alt text](clone.png)

### STEP : 4
#### Generate a token to be used as a password when executing the git push -u origin master command.

- Open setting

![Alt text](setting.png)

- Select Developer settings

![Alt text](<developer setting.png>)

- Select Personal access token (Classic version)

![Alt text](token.png)

- Click generate new token

![Alt text](<new token.png>)
!

## STEP :5 
#### Clone the Repository

- **git push -u origin master** :- Is like sending your local work to your online project's home on GitHub. It's a way to share your changes and keep everything in sync. The -u part helps set up a connection for next time.
